# Reinforcement Learning and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) Exercises

This repository contains a series of exercises focused on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**. These exercises aim to provide hands-on experience with key RL concepts such as policies, value functions, Q-learning, and optimal decision-making in uncertain environments.

The exercises are based on problem statements proposed by **Nicolas Gast**, professor in the Master MOSIG program at Grenoble INP, as part of the course **Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning (2023).**

## Exercises Overview

1. **Warm-up: Stochastic Shortest Path**  
   Solve a shortest path problem in a graph with stochastic transitions and compute the deterministic policy that minimizes the expected distance.

2. **Example of a Discounted MDP**  
   Understand and implement solutions for MDPs with discounted rewards, evaluating different policies.

3. **Game of Dice: "Stop or Continue"**  
   Formulate and solve a dice-based RL problem where you decide whether to stop or continue for maximum reward.

4. **Optimal Grid Movement and Q-Learning**  
   Explore Q-learning to determine the optimal policy for a grid-world environment.

5. **Optimal Gambling Problem**  
   Solve a classic gambling problem to maximize the probability of reaching a target while minimizing the risk of loss.

## About the Author

These implementations are part of my coursework in the Master MOSIG program at **Grenoble INP - ENSIMAG**, where I specialize in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)**. Through this repository, I aim to deepen my understanding of RL and MDPs while sharing my learning journey with others.
